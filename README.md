## About This App

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **SplashCast**, a web app that provides you with a current, localized weather forecast alongside beautiful images from the many photographers and contributers at [Unsplash](https:/www.unsplash.com/).

For quicker access, add this app to your device's home screen! See instructions for [iPhone](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/safari-101-save-website-webpage-your-home-screen-for-instant-access-0182580/) or [Android](https://www.greenbot.com/article/3041304/android/how-to-add-a-web-site-to-your-android-home-screen-with-chrome.html).

## Settings

Upon launching the app for the first time, you will be prompted to enter the name or postal code for your location. Currently, I recommend using your postal code when possible, as the weather API currently does not do a good job of differentiating between locations that share a name (I'm looking into this).

After the initial setup, individual app settings can be changed by clicking on the menu button in the top left corner of the screen. The available settings are as follows:

1. *Current Location* - Displays the current location, and allows you change it by running the initial setup again.
2. *Use Metric Units* - If enabled, displays forecast information in metric units.
3. *Prefer HD Images* - Will display higher-quality (but slower loading) backgrounds for use on HD displays.

More features and settings are planned for later releases!
